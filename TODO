Maybe an issue: If there is an instance of pacman already running *and* 
the sleep time ends, the following _pacman -Qqu_ might just exit. Thats 
no big problem but there will be no notification and we will have to 
wait for sleeptimer again. Didn't see this but it might happen. Will 
test this soon.
