Description
pacnotify is a little script to display notifications about updates. I try to follow KISS, so it really only notifies about available updates. The pacman database itself must be synced by another program.

Dependencies
libnotify

Download
pacnotify can be downloaded from Downloads. I recommand the testing version because it got most options, while master is less developed but with maybe less bugs ;). Those are archives, so untar them and then follow the steps in Installation. You can also browse the Source. And easy clone it locally

git clone https://code.google.com/p/pacnotify/
Installation
pacnotify
Copy the script to where you like. To make it accessible for all users:

cp pacnotify /usr/bin/pacnotify
chown root:root /usr/bin/pacnotify
chmod ugo+x /usr/bin/pacnotify # or chmod 744 /usr/bin/pacnotify
config file
Create file in either /etc or ~/.config. name it pacnotify.conf and fill in the values you would like to overwrite.

# time to wait between notifications
sleeptime=1h
# seconds to display the notification
expires=120
# wait x if pacman is running (in minutes) , start with a small number!
backoff=1
# limit minutes to wait (per try)
backoff_limit=30
# add x minutes delay to backoff per try
delay=5
# max tries until notification is send anyway, set to 0 to turn off waiting.
maxtries=10
# lines of packages to display (more than 9 lines may cause formatting errors)
lines=9
# icon to use for notification
icon=/usr/share/icons/pacnotify32.png # which icon to use
Important: I changed the variable expiretime to expires, so if you have a old version of the configuration file the old variable will be ignored. Set the permissions to 744

Important: If you create those files don't leave variables empty. You may omit variables that you dont want to change.

Because the values are read in this order

from script
from /etc/pacnotify.conf
from ~/.config/pacnotify.conf
the next one always overrides the previous one. making it possible for a user to have individual values.
cronjob
Note: pacnotify does not sync your pacman database. It's crucial to get your databases updated somehow, otherwise it makes no sense to run pacnotify. I recommend to create a cronjob in /etc/cron.hourly name it (e.g. pacman_sync):

#!/bin/bash
/usr/bin/pacman -Syuw --noconfirm
make it executable:

chmod ug+x /etc/cron.hourly/pacman_sync
Have a cron-like daemon/service running :P

Running
If you copied pacnotify the way described above, it is in your path. So its enough to call pacnotify. Otherwise you'll have to do something like:

./pacnotify
#or
sh pacnotify
# see man (1) sh
Note: You must either give the full path to the script, or be in the directory where the scipt is.

Thanks

Thanks to all the people that gave me hints to improve, and to everyone who tested pacnotify so far. If you did give some hints and want to be credited by name here, tell me :
