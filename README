README
I. Description
pacnotify is a little script to display notifications about updates.
I try to follow KISS, so it really only notifies about available updates.
The pacman database itself must be synced by another program.

II. Dependencies
Depends on libnotify 0.7.5-1

III. Installation
 a. config file
Create file in ~/.config/pacnotify.conf:
sleeptime=  #The time in seconds for pacnotify to sleep (man (1) sleep)
expiretime= #the time in millisecs until the message goes away 0=never
 b. cronjob
I recommend to create a cronjob in /etc/cron.hourly:
#!/bin/bash
/usr/bin/pacman -Syuw --noconfirm

IV. Running
just run pacnotify.sh after the sleeptime is elapsed pacnotify will call pacman -Qqu
which just lists the new packages, one per line. this is then stored in /tmp/qqu
 for further processing.
